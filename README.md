## 🛒 Stripe Payment (Test Mode)

This project includes a **Stripe Checkout integration** for demonstration purposes. Since this app is in **Test Mode**, no real transactions will be processed.

### 🔹 How to Test the Payment Feature

To simulate a successful payment, use the following **test card details**:

- **Card Number:** `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Expiration Date:** Any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
- **CVC:** Any 3-digit number (e.g., `123`)
- **ZIP Code:** Any 5-digit number (e.g., `10001`)

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- This is a **test checkout**, so no real money is involved.
- You can use different [Stripe test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) to simulate various scenarios, such as declined payments or insufficient funds.
